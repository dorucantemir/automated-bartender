#summary Instructions to Build

= Instructions =

1.) Start by making the bottles.  To do this cut 12 1 inch pieces of the 3/8" ID Vinyl tubing, 18 1 inch pieces of the 1/4" ID Vinyl tubing, and 6 5 inch pieces of the 1/8" ID Vinyl tubing.

2.) For each bottle put a 1 inch piece of the 3/8" ID Vinyl tubing on the end of the liquor pourer, then a 1 inch piece of the 1/4" ID Vinyl tubing inside of that.  A valve will then be put into the tubing and on the end of the vavle put a combination of 1 inch 1/4" ID Vinyl tubing, 1 inch 3/8" ID Vinyl tubing, and another 1/4" ID Vinyl tubing.  This tubing will be what connects to the valve that the servo controls.

3.) On the end of the liquor pourer that goes into the bottle put a 5 inch piece of the 1/8" ID Vinyl tubing and then put a straw on the end of that.  This allows air to flow into the bottle while it is being poured.

The finished topper should like like this:
