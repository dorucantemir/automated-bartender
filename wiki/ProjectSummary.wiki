#summary About the Project

= Automated Bartender =

This project started out with a simple idea, create a device that could be placed in a home or anyplace where people would like to have a drink but where this is no bartender to make them (although it could also serve as a tool to assist bartenders).  Through many design changes and careful considerations this idea has been materialized in the device that you see below:

= How it Works =

The Automated Bartender features up to six different bottle holders, three for different types of alcohol and three for different mixers.  Valves connected to servos control the flow of the liquid.  
 
= The Next Step =

Although Version 1.0 of the Automated Bartender fulfilled the goals set forth, there are still different features that I would like to add to Version 2.0.  The limitation that held this version back was cost.  This project was created on a tight budget but with the revenue that is obviously going to be generated from the sales of this device, the sky is the limit for the next version.  First of all I would like to use a touchscreen instead of a keypad.  Doing this would cost close to an extra $100 because an Arduino Mega is needed for the SainSmart 3.2" TFT LCD Display (cheapest touchscreen I could find) and then a ribbon cable to connect them.  I figured with Version 1.0 since a keypad could perform just as well as a touchscreen but only cost $4 it was the way to go.  Also with Version 2.0 I would like to find a way to chill the bottles.  For Version 1.0 I had gotten a thermoelectric cooler and a heatsink and fan but found that this did not have the required energy to chill six bottles.
